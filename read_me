# Robot Challenge

## Description

- The application is a simulation of a toy robot moving on a square tabletop, of dimensions 5 units x 5 units.
- There are no other obstructions on the table surface.
- The robot is free to roam around the surface of the table, but is prevented from falling to destruction. 
- Any movement that would result in the robot falling from the table is ignored, however further valid movement commands is still accepted.
- The origin (0,0) is the SOUTH WEST most corner.
- The first valid command to the robot is a PLACE command, after that, any sequence of commands may be issued, in any order, including another PLACE command.
